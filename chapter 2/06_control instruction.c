/*Determines the flow of control in a program four types of control instructions in C are:
1. Sequence Control instructions.
2. Decision Control instructions
3. Loop Control instructions
4. Case Control instructions.*/


/*
1. Sequence Control Instructions:
Definition: In sequence control, instructions are executed one after another, in the order they are written.
Example:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Step 1: Initialize\n");
    printf("Step 2: Process\n");
    printf("Step 3: End\n");
    return 0;
}

Explanation: The statements are executed sequentially: first "Initialize", then "Process", and finally "End".
*/


/*
2. Decision Control Instructions:
Definition: Decision control instructions change the flow of control based on conditions, typically using if, if-else, or switch.
*/

/*
3. Loop Control Instructions:
Definition: Loop control allows for repeating a block of code multiple times until a condition is met. 
The most common loops are "for", "while", and "do-while".
*/

/*
4. Case Control Instructions:
Definition: Case control instructions allow branching to one of many possible actions based on the value of a variable. 
This is done using the "switch" statement in C.
