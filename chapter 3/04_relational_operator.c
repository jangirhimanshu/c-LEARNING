RELATIONAL OPERATORS IN C
--> Relational operators are used to evaluate conditions (true or false) inside the if
statements.
--> Some examples of relational operators are:
-->  ==, >=, >, <, <=, !=
--> Important note: ‘=’ is used for assignment
whereas ‘==’ is used for equality check.
--> The condition can be any valid expression. In C a non-zero value is considered to be
true.  <--imp line and to verify to this line go to 05-non-zero.c
